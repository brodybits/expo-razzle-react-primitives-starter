# expo-razzle-react-primitives-starter

**LICENSE:** MIT (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE))

Clean starter project for building an app using `react-primitives` that works on both Razzle web server and Expo.

This project was originally created using `expo init` and then updated to work with both Razzle and Expo.
(This is much cleaner than combining an Expo app together with an app generated by `create-react-app`.)

## Quick start

Requirements:
- Expo CLI (`npm install --global expo-cli`)
- Yarn (*highly recommended*; use of `npm` instead of `yarn` is not tested or supported)

Within a clone of this project:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start-web` to start local Razzle web server
- `yarn start-expo` to run on Expo

## Major alternatives

With `create-react-app` / Expo app combined:

- <https://github.com/theTechie/create-react-primitive-app>
- <https://github.com/joefazz/react-native-web-starter>
  (see <https://github.com/joefazz/react-native-web-starter/pull/21> for a WIP demo using `react-primitives`)

## Major TODO items

- [ ] automatic linting
- [ ] automatic Prettier style check
- [ ] add support for automatic testing using `react-test-renderer`
- [ ] test and support conversion to React Native using `expo eject`
- [ ] upgrade to use React 16.8.x with support for Hooks - waiting for Expo to release Expo SDK 33 with React Native 0.59 (<https://twitter.com/sjchmiela/status/1113327153263910912>)
